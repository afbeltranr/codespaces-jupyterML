    "In Unit 3, we created a basic model that let us find the relationship between a dog's harness size and their boot size. We showed how this model could then be used to make a prediction about a new, previously unseen dog.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's common to build, train, then use a model while we are just learning about machine learning; but in the real world, we don't want to train the model every time we want to make a prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider our avalanche-dog equipment store scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "* We want to train the model just once, then load that model onto the server that runs our online store.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Although the model is trained on a dataset we downloaded from the internet, we actually want to use it to estimate the boot size of our customers' dogs who are not in this dataset!\n",
    "\n",
    "How can we do this?\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we'll:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a basic model\n",
